#X text 243 -88 usss.delay is a Modulating delay unit. Signal delay
times are modulated by a sine wave There are two forms of feedback
(Normal and Cross) The Normal feedback level determines the amount
of signal sent back to the inputs. It is normal in terms of its stereo
image. The left feeds back to the left and the right feeds back to
the right. Cross feedback causes the left and right to be crossed over
in the feedback stage. This can cause a bouncing between left and right.
The modualtion stage causes the delay time to be warped giving chorus
\, flange \, phasor like sounds. In the extreme you can here sound
reversals and 'DJ scratching' effects.;
