Modules must be designed such that multiple copies can exist. Except in special circumstances where multiple copies of a module make no sense.
In order for this a number of rules must be followed:

All global names must be made 'module unique' or 'abstraction unique'
This rule covers: send and receive (s and r) names, array names, delay line names etc.
Module uniqueness can be achieved with a prefix of "$1." so something like:

 send mysend 

becomes:

 send $1.mysend

in the module and all sub abstractions. When this is done sub abstractions must be passed in the $1 as the first argument after their name. So mysubpatch becomes:

 mysubpatch $1

and can then contain:

 receive $1.mysend

If the name should be unique to a single instance of an abstraction then we use a prefix "$0." which is uniquely generated by pd at load time.
